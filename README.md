If you use any of my code, please include me in the credits appropriately and a short notice via email or similar that my software is being used in your project would be very nice!

These are “subpatches” for the programming environment “Max/MSP”. You may use them by placing them anywhere in the so-called “Max Search Path”. This can be in the global path (any Max/MSP main directories) or the local one (the same directory as the patch is located in, with which you want to use these files).

Their usage and functionality should be sufficiently described in the subpatchches themselves.

Please report any bugs or comments, thank you!
